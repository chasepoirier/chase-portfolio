He was quickly able to understand complex accounting processes and translate them into a widely complimented program, as well as temper expectations for realistic timelines and still manage to overdeliver! Chaseâ€™s excellent communication ranges from writing clear emails and running effective meetings to explaining complex code in simplified terms. His passion, flexibility, leadership, and good nature has made him a highly valued member of my team!",
